The input file used for training the classifier is: 'test-inputs.txt'
The file used to predict on the trained model is: 'Final-test-inputs.txt'
The output file is: 'output.txt'
The output file contains 'True' if the input is question else 'False'.
Due to memory issues on paperspace cloud, I was unable to perform the gridsearch cross validation techniques, gradient boost classifier, and n-gram.
More info on code is on notebook: NLP_project.ipynb
and code with error to show the memory error I came across is on: NLP_project_error
